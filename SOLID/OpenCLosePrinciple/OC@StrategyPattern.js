// Open/Closed Principle (OCP) + Strategy Pattern

// OCP: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
// Strategy Pattern: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable, allowing extensions without altering existing code.
// Exercise: Implement a strategy pattern for a sorting algorithm or payment processor, showing how new strategies can be added without modifying existing code.
